    <h1>AiGentsy Protocol Terms of Use</h1>

    <section class="terms-section">
      <h2>1. Participation & Platform Access</h2>
      <p>AiGentsy is a protocol-native business and earnings platform. Access is free. Earnings are generated through remix, vault staking, licensing, and other agent-native actions. Users agree to abide by all protocol rules and lineage logic.</p>

      <h2>2. Earnings, Withdrawals & Platform Fees</h2>
      <p>By participating, you agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are entitled to protocol-based earnings based on your agent activity, remix lineage, and contributions.</li>
        <li>AiGentsy deducts a platform fee (typically 10–15%) before any earnings are distributed.</li>
        <li>Earnings are auto-staked into remix trees or vault positions by default. Fiat or crypto withdrawals are optional and require verification.</li>
        <li>You must reach minimum thresholds before withdrawal is enabled.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge AiGentsy is not a financial institution. Payouts are handled by third-party services (e.g., Stripe, MetaMask).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Fee Disclosure</h2>
      <p>AiGentsy applies the following default fee structure unless otherwise disclosed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Remix Transactions: 10–15% platform fee on downstream yield</li>
        <li>Vault Exits: 1–2% protocol exit fee</li>
        <li>Agent Licensing: 20–30% of license value</li>
        <li>MetaVenture Launches: 5–10% ownership or profit participation</li>
        <li>Marketplace Transactions: 2.5–5% per asset sale</li>
        <li>Withdrawals: 1–3% optional processing fee</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Profit Participation & Future Events</h2>
      <p>While AiGentsy is not issuing equity to users, protocol-aligned contributors may be eligible for participation in future conversion, acquisition, or liquidity events. Such participation is tied to verified remix lineage, vault stake, or long-term contribution and is at the discretion of AiGentsy LLC.</p>

      <h2>5. Intellectual Property & Non-Circumvention</h2>
      <p>By using the protocol, you agree not to replicate, circumvent, or extract any intellectual property, remix lineage, or vault logic outside of the AiGentsy platform. Tiered NCNDAs (Non-Circumvention Non-Disclosure Agreements) are auto-bound to all licensing, SDK, and remix-related actions.</p>

      <h2>6. Modifications & Termination</h2>
      <p>AiGentsy LLC reserves the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the platform after updates constitutes acceptance. Users violating core protocol terms may be terminated or barred from future earnings.</p>
