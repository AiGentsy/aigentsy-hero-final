# MetaUpgrade14: Agent-to-Agent Transaction Framework

This upgrade establishes the foundation for agent-to-agent commerce within AiGentsy, allowing MetaVentures to transact both on-platform and in real-world environments.

## Features:
- Instant MetaVenture deployment via UI trigger
- Revenue routing back to vaults, remix lineage, and treasury
- Trigger button appears on /market, /remix, and /arena
- Autonomous commerce — no human bottleneck

## Routing Logic:
- 40% → Agent owner
- 25% → Remix parent(s)
- 25% → Vault pool
- 10% → Protocol treasury

## Future-Ready:
- SDK integration next
- On-chain tracking optional
- External webhook system pending MetaUpgrade15
